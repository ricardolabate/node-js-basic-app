MEAN = MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and NodeJS

Stack:

The combination of all technologies used to build a piece

of software.

Your database system, your server side code, your client side

code and everything else.

MongoDB = Stores data in documents that look a lot like JSON
and Javascript object literal notation.

Express = Javascript framework that makes things like routing,
writing APIs and working with HTTP easier (Server side).

AngularJS = Javascript framework for managing code and UI 
in the browser, removing a lot of manual work. Connects
the interface (client side) with the server side.

NodeJS = Javascript on the server. Handle HTTP requests and
responses and lots more.

MEAN is just used to sound better the correct order would be 

MongoDB -> NodeJS -> Express -> AngularJS
